# Changelog

## 0.1.4

### Fixed

- **`Fragment` now reads `props.children`** — `createElement` passes children as `props.children` when calling function components, but `Fragment` only read rest params (which were empty). This broke all `<>...</>` usage via the automatic JSX runtime.

### Docs

- Added anti-patterns: `text()` for attributes (#6), missing dispose scopes (#9), `transition-all` CSS (#10).
- Added `computed()` for reactive attributes example and full dispose scope pattern to `jsx.md`.

## 0.1.3

### Fixed

- **`jsx-dev-runtime` now exports `jsxDEV`** — Bun's dev bundler uses `"jsx": "react-jsxdev"` internally and imports `jsxDEV`, which was missing. Added as a re-export of `jsx`.

## 0.1.2

### Added

- **Automatic JSX runtime** — `jsx-runtime.ts` and `jsx-dev-runtime.ts` enable `"jsx": "react-jsx"` with `"jsxImportSource": "@blueshed/railroad"`, so consumers can write JSX without importing `createElement`.
- **Claude Code skill** — ships in `.claude/skills/railroad/` with API reference, patterns, and anti-patterns for correct railroad code generation.

## 0.1.1

### Fixed

- **`when()` now only swaps on truthiness transitions.** Previously, any value change (e.g. `"a"` → `"b"`) would destroy and recreate the truthy branch. Now it compares `!!oldVal` vs `!!newVal` and only swaps when the branch actually changes (falsy↔truthy). Components inside each branch should use signals to react to value changes within the same branch.

## 0.1.0

### Added

- **Signals** — `signal`, `computed`, `effect`, `batch` with automatic dependency tracking and cleanup.
- **JSX runtime** — `createElement`, `Fragment` producing real DOM nodes. Signal-aware children and props auto-update via effects.
- **Reactive helpers** — `text()` for computed text nodes, `when()` for conditional rendering, `list()` for keyed list rendering.
- **Dispose scoping** — `pushDisposeScope` / `popDisposeScope` to collect and clean up effects.
- **Routes** — hash-based client router with automatic dispose scoping on navigation.
- **Shared** — typed dependency injection via `key`, `provide`, `inject`.
